        "This project started as an exploration into secure client-server communication and a desire to understand tracking systems. The goal was to build a secure pipeline to capture system inputs and transmit them to a central server, by building a pipeline from the system-level client to the public-facing web interface.",
    challenge:
        "The primary challenge was ensuring end-to-end security. This involved implementing a robust cryptographic scheme (RSA for key exchange, AES-GCM for data encryption) to prevent the log contents from being accessible over a network during transmission. Since the client was written in Python and the server was written in Go, I had to work with different cryptography packages for encryption and decryption. I also had to manage multiple distinct parts of the systemâ€”a Python client that required compilation into a Windows executable, a Go server for secure API handling, and a Next.js frontend for data visualization and distribution. Each component introduced its own set of challenges, including environment variable management, cross-language data serialization, and cloud infrastructure setup on AWS.",
    solution:
        "The solution is a multi-layered system. The lightweight Python client, packaged with PyInstaller, securely captures keystrokes and system info. It performs a cryptographic handshake with the Go server to establish a secure AES session. The encrypted logs are then sent via an API endpoint to the Go server, which decrypts them and stores them in Firestore (Firebase database). A Next.js web client then fetches this data to provide a live, transparent view of the logs, while also serving the compiled client executable directly from an AWS S3 bucket.",

    overview: "For many years, my organization, ACM UTD, has managed UTD Grades, the premier site for course optimization through grade visualization. However, I felt as though grades don't tell the full story. Many professors I've taken were tough, but I learned the most from them and appreciated them much more than courses which I had sailed by with an easy A in. I decided during the creation of SAGE's course optimizer that I would find a way to integrate more insights. The site I looked towards was RMP.",
    challenge: "Existing solutions struggled with inconsistent professor names, duplicate names and duplicate student-created RMP profiles, professors whose names have changed during their tenure, and incomplete data when merging RMP and grade sources. Similarly, RMP uses internal ids for each professor's URL, so we can't easily webscrape them. My initial approach used Selenium to navigate to the UTD page of RMP and then click the 'Show More' button to list professors until it wasn't available. However, each button click would take about 2 seconds to retrieve more professors, causing the full scrape to take several minutes. After some other attempts to speed up this process, Michael Zhao (https://www.michaelzhao.xyz/) showed me a program he had written that uses the internal GraphQL API of the RMP site to query for 1000 professors at once, drastically speeding up my RMP data sourcing.",
    solution: "The GraphQL API implementation was a huge improvement to the overall speed of the retrieval, reducing the time taken to gather data by over 95% (Selenium startup being the majority of the remainder). In addition to that, the solution implemented robust name normalization, fuzzy matching, and course overlap logic, plus manual mapping, to accurately match and merge professor data. Subsequent data obtained 20% more successful matches due to improved edge case handling and was used to enhance SAGE and UTD Grades, applications that receive tens of thousands of students worth of network traffic every semester",

    challenge:
    "There were several challenges involved with this project. When creating the frontend, I had to follow strict Spotify branding guidelines to ensure the app would be approved for public use. On the backend, the OAuth flow was quite tricky once implemented as a full-stack application rather than standalone, and I even rewrote the original Express.js server into Go, which I had never used before. Deploying the Go server to AWS EC2 was also a new experience for me, I had to work with nginx reverse proxies, buy my cloudflare domain (doypid.com), handle AWS IAM roles and EC2 configurations, write deployment scripts, work with Docker to containerize my application, and so much more.",

Additionally, there were numerous challenges in ensuring the tool worked for multiple Visio design formats, as different shapes can be used in different ways. Determining start and end nodes of a path for example began as just 'nodes with outgoing edges but no incoming edges' seemed rigid enough to determine start nodes, but many designers use that same pattern for extracting database information, where the database element would now be considered a start node.",
