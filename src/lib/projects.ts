        overview:
            "This project started as an exploration into secure client-server communication and a desire to understand tracking systems. The goal was to build a secure pipeline to capture system inputs and transmit them to a central server, by building a pipeline from the system-level client to the public-facing web interface.",
        challenge:
            "The primary challenge was ensuring end-to-end security. This involved implementing a robust cryptographic scheme (RSA for key exchange, AES-GCM for data encryption) to prevent the log contents from being accessible over a network during transmission. Since the client was written in Python and the server was written in Go, I had to work with different cryptography packages for encryption and decryption. I also had to manage multiple distinct parts of the systemâ€”a Python client that required compilation into a Windows executable, a Go server for secure API handling, and a Next.js frontend for data visualization and distribution. Each component introduced its own set of challenges, including environment variable management, cross-language data serialization, and cloud infrastructure setup on AWS.",
        solution:
            "The solution is a multi-layered system. The lightweight Python client, packaged with PyInstaller, securely captures keystrokes and system info. It performs a cryptographic handshake with the Go server to establish a secure AES session. The encrypted logs are then sent via an API endpoint to the Go server, which decrypts them and stores them in Firestore (Firebase database). A Next.js web client then fetches this data to provide a live, transparent view of the logs, while also serving the compiled client executable directly from an AWS S3 bucket.",

        challenge:
            "The project faced several challenges, including handling formatting inconsistencies across multiple years of degree catalogs, parsing transcript PDF formats reliably, and architecting a scalable system capable of supporting thousands of students. Another major hurdle was managing a team of 45+ developers, maintaining code quality, and ensuring smooth collaboration across frontend, backend, and infrastructure teams. We also needed to construct the RAG chatbot to provide accurate advising responses based on the parsed data, and integrating the RMP and university grade data for course recommendations required some creativity on sourcing our data.",
        solution:
            "We built a modular AWS-based pipeline with multiple Lambda functions, orchestrated with Step Functions. A custom Python parser replaced AWS Textract for faster and more accurate transcript processing. Degree plans are generated and stored in S3 for fast retrieval, while Pinecone is used to support semantic chatbot queries. The frontend was migrated from React to Next.js + Typescript + Tailwind for performance and scalability, with a redesigned UI for usability.",

        challenge:
        "There were several challenges involved with this project. When creating the frontend, I had to follow strict Spotify branding guidelines to ensure the app would be approved for public use. On the backend, the OAuth flow was quite tricky once implemented as a full-stack application rather than standalone, and I even rewrote the original Express.js server into Go, which I had never used before. Deploying the Go server to AWS EC2 was also a new experience for me, I had to work with nginx reverse proxies, buy my cloudflare domain (doypid.com), handle AWS IAM roles and EC2 configurations, write deployment scripts, work with Docker to containerize my application, and so much more.",
        solution:
        "The app was built using React and Typescript with tailwind for the frontend, with a Dockerized Go server deployed to an EC2 instance, storing data in DynamoDB and allowing users to modify their displayed data to customize their own wallpapers.
